            <p class="docs"><strong>By</strong>: Venus<br>Concept: The idea of “home” is seen in Espiritu’s article. Espiritu searches to find what “home” means to Filipina/o-/Americans. She explores the notion of place and how many of these immigrants situate after
              the Philippine diaspora. In the article, the construction and definition of “home” is seen being applied to Filipina/o-/Americans. These Filipina/o-/Americans are creating their homes in America while still maintaining a home in the Philippines.
              Although “home” may refer to a place of love and security, Espiritu outlines how those lines of love and security may be blurred. The lines of love and security blur due to the inevitable change in the Filipina/o-/Americans’ identities when
              living in America after immigrating from the Philippines.
              <br>
              <br> Analysis: The construction of “home” in the Philippines and America is seen through remittances, calling cards, balikbayan boxes, and more. Creating “home” is more difficult than one thinks when they break down what makes them secure
              and feel loved when referring to a “home.” For example, people feel loved when others embrace who they are. However, it is difficult for Filipina/o-/Americans to figure this out over time as their identity, who they are, changes. After a
              while, these individuals wonder if they’re really Filipino or American. They wonder if it’s possible to be both. They question how Filipino they are. From there, constructing a “home” seems difficult when the Fil-Am sees one place of more
              a “home” than the other. Regardless, it is totally possible to have a sense of home in both locations, but it isn’t easy to deem them both as home.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: This article from Espiritu hit home for me. I’ve seen it firsthand and I’ve also experienced this firsthand. Being a Filipina-American, I believe that I am equal of both Filipina and American. However, I consider America
              to be more of a home to me than the Philippines. The Philippines is a home to me in that I have family there and their house is a wonderful home that only God knows how much I love. However, I don’t know the streets of Pangasinan like the
              back of my land like I know the Bay Area. For my mom, though, she is a Filipina/American. My mother has lived in America for more than half of her life now. She knows how to drive everywhere here, she knows how to speak English, she gets
              American culture, and etc. However, she will always be in a constant state of homesickness. Although she moved to America for a better life, there is no doubt in her mind that she would love to go back to the Philippines to see her family.
              As a Fil-Am, family is a huge part of me. I can see how my mom views the Philippines as more a home to her than America because her immediate family is there - just like how mine reside in the Bay.<br>

            <button class="post2"><h4>Migration - Overseas Filipino Workers: The Making of an Asian-Pacific Diaspora by E. San Juan, Jr.</h4></button>
            <p class="docs2"><strong>By</strong>: Andrea<br>Concept: Through this publication by E. San Juan, Jr. we are introduced to the concept of “OFW” or Overseas Filipino Worker and the creation of diaspora through the individuals scattered across the globe. San
              Juan estimates over 3400 Filipinx overseas leave for work daily, joining the over ten million living overseas. The article situates this concept by grounding it in the extensive colonial historical context in which the Philippines, with
              it abundantly natural resource rich islands and seemingly objectifiable population, has battled with for decades in the past and into today. Following World War II and American occupation, the Philippines emerged as extensively dependant
              on the United States and used the nation as a model for the Globalized, developed nation it wished to be. In order to achieve this ideal, the system has pushed individuals to seek out a better life outside of the Philippines while also keeping
              strong ties to the Philippines, through the memory of family or belonging.
              <br>
              <br> Analysis: In looking at these concepts, we can truly see the devastation of the indigenous culture. Through labor, a clear picture is painted of what kind of jobs are seen as idealistic, the sacrificing of choice to pursue jobs overseas
              due to the lack of resources within the Philippines, the exploitation by the Philippines of its own people in order to sustain its economy, and, lastly, the devaluing of the Filipinx body into mere mass labor. Through land, the idea of the
              Philippines is seen as no longer being able to provide for its people and the idea of nationhood is compromised. While the change in labor, land, and way of life is evident, Filipino overseas are often times still deeply tied to the Philippines
              within the diaspora. The diaspora provides hope within an Overseas Filipino Worker by providing reinforcing nostalgia, a working goal, and an ideal of a better life that one can provide for those back home.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: The saying “OFW” is one that truly never sat well with me. It felt objectifying. It feel, to me as if we clumping an entire population, not even all occupying the same space, under this title and reducing them to nothing
              more than a measurement of input and output. While that is purely a personal sentiment, I do believe that this is an important idea to acknowledge as it encompases the change in societal models, the draining of the work force, and the possible
              shift in Filipino nationalism. This concept made me question where the boundaries of an OFW stops. Would a Filipinx immigrant today, who merely immigrates for reasons not set within the immediate need for a more “opportune” job, be considered
              an OFW if s/he settles and eventually begins working. If my parents are immigrants, does that make me an OFW when I begin working, if I consider myself Filipino? What I do take away from this reading and concept is the reinforcement of her
              stories and histories. We can remember that many Overseas Filipino Workers are forced out of the Philippines, work endless contracts, make very little, and are often far from their own kin and people. Their bravery is commendable and embraced,
              their work is valorized, and their sacrifices are eternally remembered.<br>

            <button class="post3"><h4>Migration - Review of Rick Baldoz of  Empire of Care: Nursing and Migration in Filipino American History by Catherine Ceniza Choy</h4></button>
            <p class="docs3"><strong>By</strong>: Lara<br>Concept: Through the review, Rick Baldoz thoroughly explains Catherine Ceniza Choy’s book which examines how the Americans left an impression that with a better educational system, professional jobs, an example
              being a nurse would be one of the best ways to migrate from the Philippines to the United States of America. Through the educational system that was established in the Philippines, many Filipinos wanted to seek a higher form of education
              with that being migrating to America to further their knowledge in the profession. Through this, migration of Filipinos became frequent wanting to seek new opportunities as nurses.
              <br>
              <br> Analysis: Examining the concepts presented, looking at the many Filipino Americans in the United States today, a majority of them are in the nursing field or somewhere in the medical field. Advertisements and commercials that are shown
              both in the Philippines and through the Filipino American channels market that the best jobs that will help Filipinos migrate are through nursing. Ads encourage many Filipinos to migrate to America to live the “American dream” and seek better
              opportunities.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: The concepts presented made me think and realize that it is true that many Filipino Americans do migrate to the United States for financial stability for family back home. I know family friends that are in the field of nursing
              and their in a good financial state, but I wouldn’t personally go into the field itself. I have in the past thought about taking up nursing because it will keep me financially stable, but I soon then realized that the medical field isn’t
              what interested me. On the other hand my family ended up migrating because my grandma wanted us to live a better life and be able to experience that “American dream.” It's quite interesting though because my mom would always tell me nowadays
              that she would rather grow old in the Philippines than here. In addition she would always say “a lot of people in the Philippines dream to come to America and think that it’s easy to make a living, but in reality it's much harder than living
              in the Philippines.” She would also always tell me that life in the Philippines wasn’t the most financially stable, but at least she felt happy and content with what she had.<br>

            <button class="post4"><h4>Settlement -American Journal of Sociology</h4></button>
            <p class="docs4"><strong>By</strong>: Dina <br>Concept: To begin with, I am obligated to inform my audience that the main focus of this short analysis of review will be based on Filipinos settlement in America. The word settlement can be used in multiple ways
              and meanings, therefore, I am defining it here as something that was giving up to gain something anew. In the review there is a great emphasis on how Filipinos gave up so much of their lives and family values in order to be able to live
              in America. How she talks about Filipinos are in-between two ‘homes’ who are constantly in move from one to the other, but when they do chose to stay is one then that is an obvious example of settlement. A True Loss.
              <br>
              <br> Application: Choosing to give up one home in favor of another has a tremendous psychological effect on anyone but the sacrifice should always be known and remembered. This issue is so much more obvious in the older generation because
              they have grown up in a different culture and communities which makes it ever more hard for them to accept the new life and the new home. A new land requires new connections, jobs, friends, moral values but when a mind is grown and set it
              is hard and almost impossible to change because they already lived their lives and know what or who they are. However, seeing their children and their younger generations losing the values they hold dear and expect to pass on, to be rejected
              and put aside is when the true loss and sacrifice hits them and sometimes it hits them very hard.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: As someone who had to leave her country at the age of 15, I do not truly understand the meaning of loss or sacrifice. However, knowing my father who was a very well-known person in his country and had so many connections,
              coming here was a tremendous sacrifice for him. He gave up his life, job, friends and now he at the age of 50 has to start all over again. He has to start building connections for work, community and so much more. He gave it all up so my
              sister and I could have a better life, education, and freedom, all in the cost of giving up his life. Settlement is about sacrifice and giving a piece of yourself for others, and the most tariffing aspect is not knowing if it is worth it
              or not.

            <button class="post5"><h4>Settlement - Teaching about Chicago's Filipino Americans</h4></button>
            <p class="docs5"><strong>By</strong>: Jai<br>Concept: The Filipino culture of the Midwest and east coast is rarely discussed due to the largest population of pinays/noys residing on the west coast. What I wasn't aware of is that there were “several thousand
              Filipinos who arrived in the Chicago area before 1935” (38). The majority of these Chi town Filipina/o’s were students, particularly ‘pensionado’ students, or students on a government funded study abroad program. This concept of sending
              Filipino students to prestigious midwestern universities is progressive in nature and entices Filipino prosperity. Secondly, the tydings-Mcduffie act of 1934, “promised the Philippines independence after ten years but limited Filipino immigration
              to a Fifty-per-year quota during that period” (39). I was soon to find out that this ‘Filipino Exclusion act’ and negative representations of Filipina/o’s in Chicago, and most likely nation wide, were “diminished” but not eliminated due
              to a, “joint pursuit of common goals” (39). The common goal of course, was to see the defeat of imperial Japan. The concept of ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’ applied to ethnicity is an interesting one. Finally Filipino students dissatisfaction
              with, “Exhibitions of the ‘headhunters’... with lectures by a certain self-styled authority on Philippine conditions naturally gave the American audience the impression that those were the Filipinos for whom Ex-president Wilson has recommended
              complete independence”, led to the creation of the (F.A.C) or Filipino Association of Chicago (41). The F.A.C worked to inform the American population of how capable Filipina/o’s truly are. The concept of coordination and community organizing
              as an extreme minority is brave.
              <br>
              <br> Application: In terms of settlement, Chicago was an odd area for anyone who was not of European descent. However, the Filipina/o students who traveled and eventually settled in Chicago, managed to thrive for the most part. The object
              of the pensionado student was to gain a western education and return home to the Philippines, at least to my understanding. Therefore, permanent settlement was not a plan for most in Chicago; the Tydings-Mcduffie act of 1934 restricted Filipinas/o’s
              from leaving the U.S without surrendering their right to re-entry. This forced young pinay and Pinoy students to stay in Chicago and look for work, which was scarce, during depression-era Chicago. So like us ethnic folk do, they adapted
              to American society but continued to fight for the image of their country and people, who also happened to send them on a path of education (one unfortunately not in their favor). Because flak was thrown at the Japanese during WWII filipinas/o’s
              were seen as acceptable (for the moment) by white america simply because they were victim to the Japanese and were NOT Japanese. This quick shift of public opinion was clearly a facade.To illustrate, the government so generously raised the
              quota for Filipino immigrants from 50 to 100 after the war, a feeble reward for being ‘companions’. Lastly, the formation of the Filipino Association of Chicago, and organizations that were akin to it nationwide, laid the foundation for
              modern pin@y activist and community leaders.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: Whenever I think I have it rough, I always remember that my ancestors somewhere down the line, had to secure a settlement. Whether it be clearing brush to create a village, moving into a large city, or risking it all and
              leaving their mother country for the unknown. I am puzzled to why Chicago was the chosen area to send these pensionado students. Surely the east coast was a formidable area, as there is a surplus of universities there. And it is possible
              that these Filipina/o students would be victim to added subjectivity on the east coast, but at least there would be an abundance (in comparison to Chicago) of similar cultures. This could've made it easier to cope with being out of the country.
              Growing up I was always taught geography by my mom. She showed me where I'm from, where everyone else is from, and how people got to where they are now. Because of this, my interpretation of settlement is the space you become accustomed
              to physically, but more importantly, the relationship must be beneficial both ways.<br>

            <button class="post6"><h4>Settlement</h4></button>
            <p class="docs6"><strong>By</strong>: Jesse<br>Concept: The Hart Cellar Act that increased the nation’s immigration quota, opened the doors for many Filipinos to settle throughout various parts of the United States. Prior to the Immigration act of 1965, much
              of the Filipino population were found in Hawaii and the West Coast from past generations of farm contract laborers. According to (J M Liu, 1991), “113,000 Filipinos, mainly from the Ilocano provinces, had migrated to Hawaii. Although most
              of the workers remained in the Islands, 40,000 returned to the Philippines while another 19,000 moved to the west coast”. This 19,000 that started one of the first thriving Filipino community in California soon expanded thanks to the Hart
              Cellar Act. By 1985, 667,000 Filipinos had entered the United States (J M Liu, 1991). In the east coast of the United States prior to 1965, only 7,000 Filipinos were documented to have lived in the New York/ New Jersey area. Most of this
              population were skilled workers (nurses and foreign trained doctors) in contrast to their west coast counterparts. In 1973, 63% of immigration from the Philippines were to the east coast, as the immigration act permitted prior residents
              to sponsor their immediate family over to the United States.
              <br>
              <br> Application: Filipinos have settled in various parts of the United States in the past forty years. They can be seen in American suburbs to urban mechas. One thing most Filipinos have in common is their representation within the Hip
              Hop community. In California, Filipinos are acknowledged as the introducers of Hip Hop after it’s creation in the East Coast. Their ability to assimilate was not in the typical fashion of the “American Dream” following a upper middle class,
              single home based criteria. Instead, Filipinos followed a American youth counter culture by embracing the dynamics of Hip Hop and it’s representation for people of color in the late 70’s early 80’s. Filipinos who settled in the suburbs were
              also not shy of this movement, as many busted out cardboard for bboy (breakdance) practices or dj sessions in their single home garage.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: I have moved around the country, witnessing the northeast, far south, and sunny side west. Throughout my settlement around the country, I’ve encountered various Filipinos/as embracing the culture of hip hop. In Philadelphia,
              my neighbor, whom was half Black half Filipino, loved to produce beats on his computer. When I moved to New Orleans, I knew a Filipino friend whom we use to practice breakdancing in his garage. The contrast between my urban row home in Philadelphia
              and single subdivision neighborhood in New Orleans was drastic. However, the connection between my two Pinoy friends is not only are they my best friends, they were connected through the elements of hip hop. Pinoys/Pinays may be dispersed
              throughout different environments in the country, they are still connected though the creativity and freedom of expression of hip hop.<br>

            <p class="docs7">
              <strong>By</strong>: Warren<br> Concept: To assimilate is to take in information, ideas, or culture and understand it fully. Filipinos are among many ethnic groups who move to America in order to live better lives. According to Momar Visaya’s
              Pinoys Assimilate Faster, Filipino immigrants have assimilated faster than any other group in the United States for the last 25 years.
              <br><br> Application: According to the article, Filipinos are faster than other ethnic groups, even the biggest immigrant group, Mexicans, in terms of assimilation. Schools in the Philippines understand how important it is to incorporate
              the English language in an individual’s education. Having the ability to speak one of the top three languages in the world allows Filipinos or anyone to communicate with others in this country. Unfortunately for other immigrants, some do
              not have the resources or were never provided education in order to speak English, which puts them at a disadvantage.
              <br><br> Reflection: Growing up in such a diverse part of the country, the Bay Area, I see how certain ethnic groups assimilate and I judge whether they accept being American as part of their identity. Through my own eyes, I witnessed my
              parents and other relatives adapt to a different kind of lifestyle here in the United States. I was not surprised to come across the statement about Filipinos being the fastest immigrant group to assimilate. Filipinos are more accepting
              of the American culture, which is both constructive and destructive. Being able to fluently speak English allows you to create friendships and bonds with others faster in comparison to individuals who are not as fluent. Parents believe that
              teaching their children Tagalog is not necessary because they believe it will put them at a disadvantage. In their perspectives, if they teach Tagalog to their children, they will have a Filipino accent when they speak English. Being bilingual
              in this country is an advantage and Filipinos should understand that there is nothing wrong with knowing how to speak language from the homeland.

            <button class="post8"><h4>Communities</h4></button>
            <p class="docs8"><strong>By</strong>: Stephanie<br>Concept: Community, as defined in the Merriam- Webster dictionary, “is a body of persons or nations having a common history or common social, economic, and political interests” (Merriam-Webster). Here in the
              San Francisco Bay Area, we have established many Filipino communities that come together to form a greater one. To create a community is to establish unity, but also to allow room for growth, discover commonalities, and form alliances.
              <br>
              <br> Analysis: For many Filipino Americans, we create our own communities within the larger one based on cultural similarities, similar interests, and shared experiences. The communities already established in the Bay Area, Los Angeles,
              and San Diego areas will continue to grow because of the presence they have in the greater Filipino American community. As a community, we come together in times of need and despair, as well as celebration and remembrance. For many Filipino
              Americans, their community helps them to learn more about their history, their ancestors, and their culture in general. We learn more about each other, just as we have the ability to learn about ourselves.
              <br>
              <br> Reflection: I never realized how privileged I was to grow up in the Bay Area until I moved to Florida. Growing up in such a diverse community, most of my friends were Filipino and their parents spoke Tagalog so we could relate to each
              other on that level. We were not seen as the minority. Living in Florida where the Filipino community,or Asian population in general, is not so prominent was a bit of a culture shock. Things I grew up doing in the Bay Area that I thought
              were normal, were seen as unusual and atypical. To me, eggs and rice for breakfast, lunch, or dinner is an ordinary meal. But to those outside of the Filipino community, it seemed odd, weird, and strange. Something as customary as taking
              my shoes off before I went into someone’s house was also seen as strange. Here in the Bay Area, you could say I was living in a bubble and unaware how other communities operate outside of my own. But being told you are look “foreign” and
              “exotic” will quickly open your eyes to how much other communities are not like your own.

            <p class="docs9"><strong>By</strong>: Jose<br>Concept: The word community has a great meaning behind it. Being a community means a unified body of individuals, people with common interest that live in one area. The concept that I found in the article Anxiety
              as a Tactic of Political Persuasion in a Filipino-American Newspaper by Joseph P. MacCallus was the concept of togetherness. MacCallus speaks about the community of Filipino Americans in Washington D.C. This group of people is marked by
              highly developed English language capability. In the year 1982 in Washington reflected the community to be well educated, well adjusted, and financially sound. Although, the imposition of martial law effectively fractured the Filipino American
              group along political lines, pro-and anti-Marcos, and this dichotomy lasted until the Marcos downfall in 1986. With that created issues between the communities. Although During the summer of 1982 the newspaper article “Filipino Chronicle”
              published a paper that unified the community together. MacCallus even says his his article “The paper claimed to be a "powerful voice" for the Filipino community; "a voice which prompts Filipino-Americans to become more united and actively
              involved in U.S. politics.” Through one voice, Filipinos were able to bring themselves together and unite as one again.
              <br><br> Analysis: When I see community, I see a group of people who have the same passion for something. In the concept of MacCallus, he brings out the concept togetherness by uniting the community with one voice, a leader. This shows that
              the community is a team. People to help each other out when they are at their worst. A team/community will fight but at the end of the day they know that they are still one whole family. We are surrounded by plenty of different communities
              nowadays, different types of ethnicities too. Such as friends, family, and classmates. People who have the same understanding of the passion you are into.
              <br><br> Reflection: As a person who migrated from the Philippines to the United States, I lost the community I was in back home. Although, moving to the America it enabled me to join a different type of community with a more diverse group
              of people. Moving at a young age it was hard to “fit in” with a group of people. This was due to the language barrier, the passion, the interest, and the way I was raised. Although I realized I shouldn’t change myself for other people. It
              took time but through school I was able to find that community I belonged to. Those people who share the same passion and interest that I have. This Filipino community that I found help me stay intact with myself and who I was. Till this
              day I still have my Filipino background and I am still able to speak my home’s language (Tagalog).
