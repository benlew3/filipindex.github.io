            <p class="docs">
              I am Michael Alcantar, an student and artist interested in the representation of the Filipinx artist in the contemporary art world. Filipinx artists use a variety of mediums to express their concerns about their identities, urban life in the Philippines, issues of xenophobia, displacement, and indigeneity, among other motifs. I focused on ten Philippines based artists working creatively in the contemporary field to bring attention to the growing community of Filpinx artists. I am half Mexican, a quarter Filipino and a quarter European, and much of my own artwork involves reflecting on my identity and structures of society that put us into predetermined social groups. I am interested in Art education to inform young people about the power of art in communities and society in general.

            <p class="docs2">Hi, my name is Kayla Gotangco and I am a senior in the women and gender studies program at San Francisco State University. I am a Filipina-Spanish American. My interests revolve around analyzing a plethora of platforms using learned feminist discourses while also creating my own approach to feminist theory. I am interested in discovering how feminist theory and the health industry intersect. I am currently in the midst of furthering my analysis of Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, in order to critique the inner workings of the film industry as well as offer suggestions for how we might create a more diverse industry in terms of race, gender, and story arcs.

            <p class="docs8"><strong>By</strong>: Jess DeFranco<br>
              <br>Pre-colonial practices for physical and spiritual healing in the Philippines was mainly in the role of the babaylan. Predominantly women, the babaylan wielded social and spiritual power. Her role was that of a matriarch and leader until Spanish colonization in the 16th century and the resulting spread of Catholicism that still conquers the Philippines as the majority religion to this day. Also dating back before western colonization, medicinal practices relied heavily on herbs and food as a form of healing. Thankfully, the knowledge of the properties of certain food are still known today by Filipina/os passing down this knowledge from generation to generation for centuries.

              Filipino American health and wellness has ties with food and body image. Because Filipino Americans have some of the highest rates of depression and diabetes, it can then be seen that Filipino Americans have a difficult time with maintaining a positive body image. According to [insert name here], Filipina women in urban areas in the Philippines struggle with their self esteem. Unsatisfied body image can also be related to Filipinos within the diaspora as well.
