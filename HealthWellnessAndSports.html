            <p class="docs"><strong>By</strong>: Rosely Marquez<br>
              Football is a sport that is not played by many Filipinos, especially in the NFL. I interviewed a couple of young Filipino football players about their experiences. N.J Acosta, 24 and Luke Cruz, 18 both attending college, experienced, at one point in their lives, their families not supporting their football careers. Acosta said that he was in the PeeWee league when he was in elementary school but in high school he was forced to quit. “My parents didn’t let me [play]. They thought I was too small and thought that I I might break my bones. I wanted to though, my parents were protective,” he replied, after  I asked him why he was forced to quit.  Cruz, originally a wrestler, expressed that his family was not fond of the idea of him playing football. Cruz explained, “At first they weren’t [supportive], because they didn’t want me to get hurt for wrestling. And later on in the year, my sophomore year, they especially didn’t want me to, because I was pulled up for varsity.” He clarified that his family was familiar with wrestling because his cousin wrestled. They were unfamiliar with football, they didn’t know how safe it was. He added, “My whole family is supportive now. Once they saw me play, they started to support me. My mom was always supportive from the start.”  Another component for a reason why many Filipinos did not play football. I asked Acosta, an alumni of Burton High School, if there were a good amount of Filipino players at his high school , he said “Yeah, there was a pretty good amount, if they had the grades.” He explained that some Filipino students could not make the team or suspended from the team because they did not meet academic requirements. Cruz, who went to South City High School had a different exposure. Most of Filipinos who went to South City High School had the grades, but they didn’t “try out.”

There are several different dance practices with the Filipino culture such as Tinikling, Pandanggo sa ilaw, Maglalatik, Kuratsa, Itik-Itik, and many more. The national dance of Tinikling represents a tikling bird that reflects elements of a daily Philippine life. Walking through tall grass blades and tree branches. This dance uses two bamboo poles that are held by dancers on both ends of the poles. The dancers are hoping in and out of the bamboo poles while the holders are moving them back and forth as well. This dances becomes increasingly faster and faster.

            <p class="docs3"><strong>By</strong>: Kristina Santiago<br><br>The idea of mental health is about how a human being’s mind is being triggered and how it affects the person; it doesn’t matter how or why have it it can just come out of nowhere, or maybe growing up, it stayed with the person.  One thing that can help improve a person’s mental health is of course is self-care.  From there, people can find additional help from others to get better. <br>

              Filipino-Americans are reported to be one of the highest group in the Asian community that have taken or abused drugs, alcohol, and tobacco use. Drugs are specifically significant in the Filipino-American culture because study has shown that Filipinos use drugs when they either feel isolated or depressed. However, in the Philippines, President Duterte has a different opinion on drugs and since incumbent in the office, more than 4,000 people have been reported dead in the drug trade.

            <p class="docs5"><strong>By</strong>: Jorrell Cid<br>Filipino/a basketball has been around for quite some time now and to see the evolution of the game itself as well as the people who participate in it will always have a growing part in their lives. Basketball is one of those things that will make or break friendships depending if you take it serious or for fun. This brings about the idea of lifestyle being intertwined with labor/success. Growing up in my household it was kind weird to be told to grow up with two choices for my future: work in the medical field or be a professional athlete. As a young kid to have your future somewhat decided for you is a tough thing to swallow just because I have no say. In my eyes, there are two kinds of people that pertain to basketball. One, is the basketball player who has a really good chance to make it to the pros, but only has a high school degree with one year of experience in college. Then, there is the second basketball player who has a high school degree, went to a 4-year college, and plays basketball on the side as a hobby. Two different lifestyles and types of success, but the same as to how we represent who we are.<br>

            <p class="docs6"><strong>By</strong>: Mav DeCastro<br><br>Soccer, in many ways, has transformed Philippine sports in the last century. Ranging from youth soccer to the proud national team called “ the Azkals”, Filipinos have kept up with other countries in terms of competitive Soccer. Instead of being known for just Basketball or Boxing, Soccer has also been a sport in which many Filipinos have grown to play and master. Although the Azkals have gained most of the attention, little do people know, Soccer has been one of the crucial and key sports in Philippine history. Dating back all the way to the 1800’s, one of the very first sports introduced in the Philippines was indeed Soccer, or Football. Soccer was introduced when English/European settlers came to the Philippines and it slowly grew from small teams to the national league. The first official Soccer match in the Philippines took place in the year of 1907 and the first Azkal was Paulino Alcantara Riestra, who was half Spanish and half Filipino born in Iloilo City. Riestra ended up playing for FC Barcelona and till this day, is known to be the youngest player to score and play for FC Barcelona in the years of 1912-1927, scoring above 350 goals in his entire career. Since then, more clubs, like the Philippine Amateur Football Association (now known as the Philippine Football Federation) started to open up, eventually building up the culture of Soccer in the Philippines.<br>

            <p class="docs7">

              <strong>By</strong>: Jesse Leocario<br>
              Boxing has a rich history embedded in the Philippines. Introduced by U.S. soldiers during American occupation of the Philippines, boxing was brought to help decrease levels of suicide, alcoholism, and illness. Boxing was also to help promote self-reliance and resourcefulness to sudden dangers or difficulties. Before Spanish colonialization, Filipinos had the martial art of Suntukan, which was often reffered to as “dirty street boxing.” Suntukan also focused on attacking the upper body, but some key differences were the usage of bladed weapons, and more brutal attacks that were designed for hurting or even crippling opponents. Suntukan was later banned for its brutality under Spanish Colonialization, and many turned to boxing as a substitute. In the end, boxing has made an impact in the Philippines and is a popular sport, with the Philippines producing some of the worlds amazing boxers, such as Pancho Villa and more recently Manny Pacquiao. <br>

              <br>Pre-colonial practices for physical and spiritual healing in the Philippines was mainly in the role of the babaylan. Predominantly women, the babaylan wielded social and spiritual power. Her role was that of a matriarch and leader until Spanish colonization in the 16th century and the resulting spread of Catholicism that still conquers the Philippines as the majority religion to this day. Also dating back before western colonization, medicinal practices relied heavily on herbs and food as a form of healing. Thankfully, the knowledge of the properties of certain food are still known today by Filipina/os passing down this knowledge from generation to generation for centuries.

              Filipino American health and wellness has ties with food and body image. Because Filipino Americans have some of the highest rates of depression and diabetes, it can then be seen that Filipino Americans have a difficult time with maintaining a positive body image. According to [insert name here], Filipina women in urban areas in the Philippines struggle with their self esteem. Unsatisfied body image can also be related to Filipinos within the diaspora as well.

              <p id="MJ"class="bio">Hey there! My name is Jess DeFranco and I am majoring in Dance and, after the amazing experiences in this class, planning to minor in Asian American Studies! This class has really helped me get back in touch with my heritage and explore more of my identity as half white, half Filipina queer woman.  Much of being a dance major involves being creative in my art form and innovative in my performances. I feel like furthering my studies into my heritage and those of other Asian Americans can help me in touching down on different narratives and topics. This class was truly amazing and made my mornings brighter!</p>
