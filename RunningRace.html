            <p class="docs"><strong>By</strong>: Aldriene Ladlad<br><strong>Racial Tension</strong><br><br>
              The concept “racial tension” can defined as the feeling that exists when people often do not trust and are usually aggressive towards each other. One clear example that displayed that the Filipino-American ethnicity continually remains a target of racial
              tension was when Anti-Filipino graffiti messages were stated to be found on various Filipino-American establishments in Union City, California,like the restaurant Toppings Too, Filipino Advocates for Justice office and the Filipino Community
              of Alvarado and Vicinity building, which currently houses various offices including the Union City Chamber of Commerce. As stated by the Union City Police Department “it can be possibly hinted that the hate crime towards the Filipino-American
              ethnicity first began after the renaming of Alvarado Middle School after Filipino-American labor leaders Larry Itliong and Philip Veracruz”.<br><br>
              <strong>Prejudice and Discrimination</strong><br><br>The concept “racial tension” can also be described as easily caused by acts of prejudice and discrimination towards a certain ethnicity. A second clear example that displays how the Filipino-American
              ethnicity continually remains a target of racial tension/hate crime was when Robert Martirez, a “Pinoy” of Filipino descent was viciously assaulted and killed by an unknown assailant in the city of Queens, New York for unknown reasons/purposes.<br>

            <p class="docs2"><strong>By</strong>: Benjamin Lew<br><strong>Sugarcane</strong><br><br>Institutionalized racism are patterns of social institutions that give negative treatments to a group of people based on their race. Actions such as lower wages to banning of movement by the government were enacted
              upon the Filipino people throughout American history. <br><br> For example, in the early 1900’s while the Japanese workers started to move up in social classes in Hawai’i, the “Filipino laborers became a member of a ‘ feudal class bound
              to the soil and more or less subject to the will of his lord’...their contracts bound them to specific plantations; they could neither leave the island of their residence nore move elsewhere without permission of the plantation owner.” As
              the Japanese and other ethnic groups that were working on the sugarcane plantations were moving on from serfdom contracts and able to move into more urban settings throughout the islands, the lack of literacy and education for the Filipino
              males created a vacuum of social mobility and pay wages. “The average Filipino male aged 15 and over earned $9,511 in 1979 as compared to the Hawaii average of $11,505, among the major groups…”<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Land</strong><br><br>As Bonus wrote, “Although they [Filipino workers] arrived with U.S. passports(and, therefore, as U.S. nationals, because of the Philippines’ status as a colony), Filipinos were ineligible for citizenship and were
              legally barred from voting, establishing a business, holding private and public office, and owning land and other property”. This portrays the view of the U.S. government on people that they rule over and/or colonized, but do not see as
              its citizens. The U.S. only viewed the Filipinos as a ward of the state. As thus, the Philippines were under American jurisdiction and control. <br><br> As non-American citizens, the limitations for Social Mobility of the Filipino people
              were extremely limited. As in Hawai’i, they were there only to work the land but not live on it. The conditions of their living environment throughout the U.S. could be considered abysmal. They had to deal with the lowest wages amongst the
              other labor workers as well as live in the filthiest conditions, regardless of being in Hawai’i or U.S. mainland.<br>

            <p class="docs3"><strong>By</strong>: Flordellyn Arroco Castillo<br><strong>What is Model Minority Myth?</strong><br><br>The Model Minority Myth “contends all Asian Americans [as] well-educated, successful, and law-abiding citizens in the U.S. in comparison to other racial/ethnic minority groups of color (ie: African Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Americans)
              who are stereotyped to be the opposite of the model: uneducated, unintelligent, and prone to crime,” (Nadal & Sue, 1999, Uba, 1994). Because of this myth, teachers, researchers and psychologists assume that many Asian Americans are doing
              well for themselves, contrary to the actual experiences of Asian Americans. For instance, many Asian American subgroups (such as Filipino Americans) encounter a number of experiences that oppose the Model Minority Myth - these issues range
              from poverty, lower educational achievement, HIV/AIDS, teen pregnancy and gang involvement. But, these issues continue to go unnoticed because Asian Americans are the model minority in the eyes of the majority of the United States’ population.
              To leave a legacy behind, one must live their genuine life. And this proves to be a challenging task when the stereotypes that are placed upon Asian Americans are all that one is faced with on an everyday basis.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Effects of Asian American Stereotypes on Asian Americans</strong><br>
              <br>“The model minority stereotype could also have psychological, emotional, and social costs for Asian American students, such as studying harder and longer, foregoing social life, enduring loneliness and alienation, and experiencing extreme
              depression and stress,” (Zhang, 2010). There are a lot of expectations from these students - from their parents, and from the larger society. For instance, Asian Americans are stereotyped into being really good at math or someone who gets
              straight A’s. While this may be viewed as a “good” stereotype for some, it is these kinds of high expectations that make it hard for Asian Americans to live their genuine lives. The American mainstream media, for instance, portrays Asian
              Americans as “all work, no play nerds, non-confrontational and speak poor English with an accent, exotic, non-American, and foreign,” (Zhang, 2010). Many Asian Americans are tired of being stereotyped as someone who doesn’t know English
              well. A majority of Asian Americans speak English as the language that they use on an everyday basis, so exotifying Asian Americans as people who can’t speak English is an incomprehensible phenomenon that needs to be diminished. On top of
              that, often, instead of hiring Asian American actors to portray Asian American characters, they would portray them using Yellow Face instead - a baffling reality. Filipino Americans, for instance, do not necessarily have yellow skin tones,
              so the stereotype that all Asians and Asian Americans are yellow are wrong. So, if one lives in a city with a diverse group of people and a great number of Asian Americans, it’s easy to dispel such stereotypes - but what if one lives in
              a place where the Asian American population is scarce? Or the only Asian American in their town is a Filipino American who doesn’t fit the physical characteristics of Asian American stereotypes, what would happen then? All one would know
              of Asian Americans is how they see them portrayed in the media. And these stereotypes that are being portrayed for the larger society to see is not good for the Asian Americans who are simply trying to live their lives - as Americans.<br>

            <p class="docs4"><strong>By</strong>: Jezryll Sapado<br><strong>Female</strong><br><br>Often times men prefer Asian women or would say Asian women are their “type.” I couldn’t understand how we are someone’s type or why men often refer to us or categorize us under a certain type of theirs. Suddenly,
              it became clear, Asian women especially us Filipina women are known to be nurturing. We are women who are believed to be obedient and won’t talk back to men. We are expected to be good at cleaning, cooking, household duties, and what a typical
              women should do, waiting on the men hand and foot. From these stereotypes typically affiliated to us Filipina women, it’s as if men other than Filipino men want us because we are someone who would take care of them rather than being their
              partner. Men also look at Asian women as sexual objects, domestic servants, and exotic images of Geishas, that they believe Asian women are to satisfy the needs of men sexually and nothing more.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Male</strong><br>
              <br> While women are being exoticized for their beauty, Asian American men are looked at the opposite way. Many people have these perceptions because the way Asian American men are portrayed, that they lack masculinity. Many people assume
              all Asian American men aren’t tall enough, are too nerdy, and not enough of a typical athlete to satisfy the fantasy of what every female is looking for in a man. Most females either look for a white or black man. Due to the misconceptions
              placed on them, women start to believe that it is better to date men who can satisfy their needs because an Asian man can’t because they are stereotyped to have a smaller package. To some women Asian men are considered an “option” because
              they’re believed to be so smart that they are able to obtain a good high paying job.<br>

            <p class="docs6"><strong>By</strong>: Kyla Williams<br><strong>Part 1</strong><br><br> Racism has been riddled throughout American history. As a new immigrant group emerges, seeking better opportunities, they are forced to face oppression and segregation creating a barrier to break through. As the
              Filipinos start to immigrate as the main labor force, replacing the Chinese due to the Chinese Exclusion Act, they are forced to adapt to a country suppressing their success. Other social issues, such as the model minority myth and other
              stereotypes have made it difficult for Filipino Americans to create their own legacies in the larger society. Often portrayed as exotic, foreign and not fluent in English, Asian Americans are placed in a bubble that is created by outsiders.
              And it is up to us to show that this is simply not the case.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Part 2</strong><br><br>When the U.S. Naval base was closed in the Philippines in 1992, A naval base that had been there for over half a century, over 50,000 children were left behind without fathers and sometimes, even their mothers,
              who either were ashamed to have a child out of wedlock or were to poor to care for their child. These children are called “Amerasians” (Children who are born in Asia but to U.S. Servicemen). Although there was an act enacted called the American
              and/or Amerasian Immigration Act passed in 1982, for those born between December 31, 1950 to October 22, 1982, this was only extended to certain countries such as Cambodia, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, but not to the Philippines. Many
              of the children born to U.S. Servicemen who left in 1992 lived in poverty, had problems with alcohol and drugs, and faced discrimination in the Philippines, specifically those who were born to African American fathers, many of these children
              faced discrimination for their darker skin complexions. There is this pain for many “Amerasians” in the Philippines struggling with their identity and how that connects to the abandonment of their fathers

              <strong>Post 1</strong><br><br>
              One book that discusses Asian Americans in the media is Virtual Orientalism. The book discusses how Asian Americans are both represented and not represented in the media. For example Asian Americans aren’t represented in media and are replaced with those deemed as more “masculine” and can fit the roles of the hero. When we are represented, it’s within the lines of what society expects of us. Fitting the roles of the martial arts sifu, the “Asian Baby Girl” or the exotified nerd. Asian Americans play a certain role in American Pop culture, that don’t allow them to move past a certain point within media. It also delves deeper into the idea of sifu’s and monks. Understanding the spirituality that demystifies their appearances, rather than looking at them from a certain perspective. By breaking the different stereotypes that surround these Asian Roles in media, one can understand where they really come from, as well, as understand the social structures that force Asian Americans into a box. It’s the same social construct that doesn’t allow Asian Americans see, or develop past a certain point in fear of breaking the glass ceiling that keeps white and mainstream Americans on top. It also allows us to look at the real religion that, is both shown and ignored within the media.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Post 2</strong><br><br>The article is called Restrictive Portrayals of Asians in the Media and How to Balance Them. This article covers how Asian Americans are portrayed within social media. Many Asian Americans are restricted in what roles they can play. “Asian Americans in diverse, mainstream occupations: doctors, lawyers, therapists, educators, U.S. soldiers, etc.” (MANAA, 2) Asians play to what is acceptable for Western/ American culture. Another problem is that it puts Asian American actors in limbo. Having to fight between their loyalty of the old country, and their place within the United States. This article also introduces the concept of “Stereotype Buster”. That Asian Americans are good contributors to American society, and there is much more to us then the stereotypes that are given to us. That Asian Americans are able to take on lead roles, that encompasses their own identity as it is and not as its assumed to be. Personally I think that its true, and that Asian Americans need to have that larger role within society. I want to see more Asian Americans that break these stereotypes, and show the next generation of youth that we are more than what people think we are., <br>

              <strong>Filipino Americans at San Francisco State University</strong>
              <br><br>
              At San Francisco State University, a class is offered titled “Filipino American Identities,” taught by Alyson Tintiangco-Cubales. I was gracious enough to participate
              in this course and have come in to contact with individuals that I have more in common with than I could ever imagine. On the first day of class, Ate Alyson asked us to go around the room and talk about the most racist, stereotypical thing
              we had ever heard directed towards us. The thought was terrifying considering we had known each other for all of about 10 minutes. But walls were broken, guards were let down, and emotions began to pour out. Words like nurse, care-taker,
              spoil-of-war and dog-eater echoed in the room. While I had experienced racism in my short lifetime, I had never realized how common it was amongst other Filipino Americans. It goes without saying that racism can deter the growth and association
              with one’s culture, but with safe environments that encourage and nourish the acceptance of race and identity, a positive outlook on one’s self is inevitable, despite the naysayers.

              <strong>Developing Filipino American Identity</strong><br><br>The concept of race is a hypothetical one, simply based on the color of one’s skin (Tintiangco-Cubales). However, this is a widely accepted form of categorization. Filipino Americans
              have struggled greatly with the concept of race, especially those that fall victim to Colonial Mentality. Kevin Nadal defines colonial mentality as “the concept that the colonizer’s values and beliefs are accepted by the colonized as a belief
              and truth of their own; that the mores of the colonizer are superior to that of the colonized” (Nadal) This is strongly evident in the common desire amongst Filipinos to have whiter skin because “white is superior.” Giving in to colonial
              mentality leads to a difficulty in the development of Filipino American identity. Without a proper framework of history or connection to culture, Filipino Americans can struggle with who they are, where they came from, and what they associate
              as their “race.” Growing up in America, many succumbed to American ideals and often times developed a more “suburban” mindset. This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of one’s self.<br>

            <p class="docs9"><strong>By</strong>: Myles Gasmin<br><strong>Interpersonal Racism: Conceptualization</strong><br> <br>Interpersonal racism is the racism that occurs between individuals. It is the holding of negative attitudes towards a different race or culture (Intergroup Resources). Negative attitudes
              are not necessarily a prerequisite in interpersonal racism; subconscious racism becomes interpersonal racism through racial microaggressions. We may mean well, but not recognizing the racism in our subconscious still has a negative effect
              on others. Being raised in a Filipino household may have molded certain racist beliefs we have about other races. Because of this, it is extremely important that we are cognizant of everything we say. A part of growing up is questioning
              everything we have ever been taught, everything we believe in, and separating the right from the wrong.

              <strong>Racial Discrimination and Health Among Asian Americans: Evidence, Assessment, and Directions for Future Research</strong><br><br>Intrapersonal, or internalized, racism is racism that exists within individuals. It is when one holds negative
              ideas about his/her own culture, even if unknowingly (Intergroup Resources). We can’t control what other people think about us or our cultures, but we can control what we think and how we feel about ourselves. Our thoughts of ourselves then
              turn into self-hate which influences our identity. The article “Racial Discrimination and Health Among Asian Americans” on the Oxford Journal features self-reported discrimination among Asians or Pacific Islanders dating back from 1996 to
              2009. This leaves non-reported discrimination and discrimination from 2009 until now all unaccounted for. The saying “before loving someone else, you must learn how to love yourself” comes to mind. We have to overcome any intrapersonal racism
              before we can effectively attack interpersonal racism. <br>

            <p class="docs10"><strong>By</strong>: Rizza Collo<br><strong>Part 1</strong><br><br>Mental health can be defined as “emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Filipino
              Americans are dealing with psychological problem in the daily basis because of lower socioeconomic status, they are also high-risk group for mental disorder (Sanchez & Gaw 811). Because of notions of mental illness, they tend to avoids the
              help from services, they underutilize health and mental health services more than other Asian American groups and Filipino Americans who do seek treatment had more severe or dysfunctional psychological disorders.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Part 2</strong><br><br>There are top issues where Filipino are in the high risk of illnesses, like “cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. The reason why Filipino American are the highest risk of hypertension is due to “years
              of living in America and the associated accumulation of stress, leading to chronic health risks and conditions” (386). Because of Filipino oppression, many Filipino American community are challenged stereotypes like race, class, gender identity
              and sexuality. These are considered to be microaggressions. This type of statement can make a huge impact to many people and can result in negative emotions towards historically oppress groups. Because of negative emotions they go through,
              they are unable to work or do any physical activity due to feeling negative emotions.<br>
